My intrest in the feild of cs start in middle school 
It stareted with my frist experion on scratch the block coding site i was memsmorised by the possiblilities that coding/technology can bring
Being an immigrant child I was relatively unexperineced with technology at that time but my intrest was their and it was real.
Going into high school at Lane Tech College prep I started with a Web Development class Html/Css were my first real introduction into the World of code.
AS the year went on we slowly transitioned into java I started to sturggle during this peiod of my freshman year I was confused and lost
After this year I did AP Csp with this class I had an amazing teacher in that class.
